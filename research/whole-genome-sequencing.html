                            Genome-wide association studies have shown that thousands of individuals need to be included in complex disease association studies to ensure that variants of small to modest effect can be robustly identified.
                            Furthermore, these studies have demonstrated that many complex disease risk loci lie outside of exons, in the non-coding parts of the human genome.
                            Taken together, these two observations suggest that many thousands of individuals will need to be whole-genome sequenced to identify low-frequency and rare variants underlying complex disease risk.
                            Sadly, though next-generation sequencing has greatly reduced the cost associated with sequencing a human genome, it is still prohibitively expensive to sequence thousands of individuals at high genomic coverage (say 40X coverage and above).
                            It has recently been shown that sequencing thousands of individuals at low depth (e.g. 6X and below) and then using imputation-based genotype refinement can identify a large fraction of rare and low frequency variants and yield accurate genotypes at these variants.
                            Falling sequencing costs are only now making such experiments a possibility.

							<i>Inflammatory Bowel Disease</i>: Together with Jeff Barrett's group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, we are undertaking one of the largest whole-genome sequence based studies of a complex disease to date.
							The study consists of 3000 Crohn's disease cases sequenced at an average depth of 4X (funded by the Wellcome Trust) and 2000 ulcerative colitis cases sequenced at an average depth of 2X (funded by the UK Medical Research Council).
							The controls consist of 2000 individuals from the TwinsUK cohort and 2000 individuals from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), sequenced at an average depth of 6X as part of the UK10K project.
							All the sequencing is now complete and we are currently undertaking genotype calling across all 9,000 samples.
							The project also involves some methodological components and we are particularly interested in investigating the effect that the differences in average depth have on our association analyses.

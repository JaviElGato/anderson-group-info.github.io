                            	GWAS utilise high-throughput genotype microarray technology to perform screens of common genetic variation for association to complex traits and diseases.
                            	We now know that the vast majority of common variants underlying these traits have modest effects sizes (odds ratios are typically less than 1.4) so large collections of cases and controls are needed to significantly detect these associations.
                            	Prior to the advent of GWAS only a small handful of genetic loci had been mapped for complex phenotypes. Today, GWAS and GWAS-meta-analyses have identified more than 1000 risk loci and these have greatly aided our understanding of disease etiology.   
                            <p>
                            	Before arriving at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute several of us had already embraced GWAS.
                            	Carl had been involved in analysis of the WTCCC 1 and 2 studies of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and also led the analysis of the largest GWAS of endometriosis. 
                            	As part of his PhD work at the University of Edinburgh, Jamie performed a GWAS of uric acid levels and Gout, while Eva spent some time during her Masters project working on a GWAS study of obesity (in Ines Barrosso's group here at Sanger).
                                Jimmy loves a GWAS, and while he was at Queensland Institute of Medical Research he carried out studies of glaucoma, melanoma, height and BMI.

                            	<i>Primary Biliary Cirrhosis</i>: The first GWAS project within the group was of PBC and was conducted as part of the WTCCC3 study in collaboration with the UK PBC Genetics Consortium.
                            	We identified 12 new susceptibility loci and replicated all previously associated loci.
                            	We identified three further new loci in a meta-analysis of data from our study and previously published GWAS results.
                            	For many of the associated loci, we identified plausible candidate genes that support the involvement of the innate and adaptive immune systems in PBC etiology, particularly signalling via the NF-ÎºB, TLR and TNF pathways.
                            	A GWAS meta-analysis of PBC is currently underway, and the UK lead for this is Prof. Heather Cordell at the University of Newcastle.

                            	<i>Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis</i>: The UK PSC Consortium have genotyped almost 1200 PSC cases using the Illumina Omni-2.5 array.
                            	The data are being combined with similar cohorts from both the European and US PSC consortia in a meta-analysis, which Sun-Gou is currently working on as part of his PhD project.
                            	We will be combining the data with results from the International IBD Genetics Consortium to further investigate the genetic relationship between PSC and IBD.
